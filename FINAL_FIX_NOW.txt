🔥 FINAL FIX - Database Schema Issue
=====================================

THE PROBLEM:
============
Your database's 'answers' table is missing the 'is_correct' column.
Error: "Could not find the 'is_correct' column of 'answers' in the schema cache"


THE FIX (2 STEPS):
==================

STEP 1: Fix Database Schema
----------------------------
Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/uekqrkjiunezsytzyjmx/sql/new

Copy/paste ALL of this file:
📁 FIX_ANSWERS_TABLE.sql

Click "RUN"

You should see:
✅ FIXED - is_correct column exists


STEP 2: Test Again
-------------------
Refresh your browser and play the game.

The error should be gone!


WHAT THIS DOES:
===============

1. Creates 'answers' table if it doesn't exist
2. Adds 'is_correct' column if it's missing
3. Creates indexes and RLS policies
4. Verifies the fix worked


IF YOU WANT TO CHECK FIRST:
============================

Run: CHECK_ANSWERS_TABLE.sql
This shows what columns your answers table currently has.

Then run: FIX_ANSWERS_TABLE.sql
This adds any missing columns.


AFTER FIXING:
=============

The game will:
✅ Record answers in database
✅ Show correct/wrong feedback
✅ Display correct answer when you select wrong one
✅ Calculate points properly
✅ Randomize questions per player


WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?
====================

Your database schema is out of sync with the code.
Probably because:
- Database was created before schema file was updated
- Migration wasn't run when deploying
- Table was manually edited

This fix brings everything into sync.


NEXT STEPS:
===========

1. Run FIX_ANSWERS_TABLE.sql (most important!)
2. Refresh browser
3. Play game
4. Should work perfectly now!

If you see any other errors, share them and I'll fix immediately.
